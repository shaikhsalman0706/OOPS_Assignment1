The idea is to provide a simplified view of a complex system, so that users can interact with the system without having to understand the underlying details.\n",

The user does not need to know the details about the engine, transmission, and other internal parts of the car to operate it. This is an example of abstraction, as the user is only presented with the essential information and the underlying complexity is hidden."

    "#### Encapsulation, on the other hand, is the mechanism of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, or object. Encapsulation provides a level of security, by preventing access to the internal representation of an object from the outside. This protects the object's internal state from being corrupted by external code and ensures that any changes to the state of an object are made through the object's methods.\n",

    "#### Consider a television remote control. From the perspective of the user, the remote control provides an abstraction of the underlying complexity of a television. The user only needs to know a few basic operations, such as turning the TV on and off, adjusting the volume, and changing the channel. The implementation details of how these operations are accomplished is hidden from the user.\n",

The internal representation of the state of the television, such as the current volume or channel, is hidden from the user and can only be manipulated through the buttons on the remote control. This ensures that the internal state of the television is protected from being corrupted by external factors, such as accidental bumps or drops, and that any changes to the state are made in a controlled and predictable manner.\n"

    "#### Encapsulation: Encapsulation involves wrapping data and functions that operate on that data within a single unit, or object. This allows you to hide the implementation details of the object's data and functions from the outside world and provides a way to access and manipulate the data only through a well-defined interface, such as the object's methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Abstraction: Abstraction involves defining the essential features of an object, without exposing the underlying implementation details. In Python, you can achieve abstraction by defining abstract base classes and concrete subclasses. An abstract base class defines the essential properties and methods of an object, while concrete subclasses provide the implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Information hiding: Information hiding is a technique used to protect the internal representation of an object from being corrupted by external code. By making the internal data and functions of an object private or protected, you can ensure that they can only be accessed and modified through the object's well-defined interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Polymorphism: Polymorphism involves using a single interface to represent multiple types of objects. In Python, you can achieve polymorphism through the use of inheritance and method overriding. For example, you can define a common interface for a set of related classes, and each concrete class can provide its own implementation of the interface, based on its specific needs."
